## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I learned a lot during this project, as this was the first project I've ever done with not only React, but JavaScript. The biggest learning curve was understanding how to structure the app. First going in, I tried building everything inside App.js as one big component. It didn't go well.

I also learned alot about props and how to pass state from the parent component into the children component via props.

I also learned how to customize styles based on a state value.

### Continued development

I want to continue focusing on React apps. React seems incredibly powerful and I want to make larger, more intricate apps. Plus, I have a lot to learn.

### Useful resources

- [Sitepoint React Calculator Tutorial](https://www.sitepoint.com/react-tutorial-build-calculator-app/) - This helped me understand how to structure a react application. It also showed me what a wireframe was. This was very helpful for planning out my own program.
